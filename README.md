# 834-file-format
This script fromats 834 eligiblity files for certain vendors/clients. What is dose specifically is that any segment in the block of data between SE and ST if the block contains "AI*C" it will delete the block. 
Before I run this script I open the text file in notepad++ and I have to make it readable for me by replacing the (:) with \r\n.
